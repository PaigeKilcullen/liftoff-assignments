### Overview
An app that keeps track of when groceries are going to go bad to prevent food waste. It is a common issue for people with ADHD or other neurodivergencies to keep track of produce they buy and use it before it spoils, some people use index cards magnetically placed on their fridge to keep track of what they have, but this can easily take up space and become informational overload —— contradicting the original problem we're trying to solve. This app keeps track of what you have bought from your grocery list and will alert you when food is about to spoil and offer recipes within your dietary needs and current ingredients so you can use your produce before it spoils, limiting food and money waste. 

### Features

It functions as a home page that will lead to all the other features which are a shopping list which the user interacts with to create a grocery list and then push their aqcuired groveries to their digital "fridge/pantry", the "fridge/pantry" page will display all current groceries and if they are going to spoil soon and can be edited directly by users, and then a recipes page that will display recipes that use ~80% of current produce.
